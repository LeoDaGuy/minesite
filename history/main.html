    <div id="info">
      <p> <strong> Minecraft: Bedrock Edition </strong> came out was first released in July 2011, and the full release was around the end of 2016. This version has less features, like limited mods/servers, a limit to multiplayer, and less updates, but it's still good. The good thing about Minecrft: Bedrock Edition is that it's availible on almost all devices, including  Android, IOS,and all major consoles. Also, it sometimes costs less. <strong> Minecraft: Java Edition </strong> came out in May 2009, with the full release around the end of 2011. The Java Edition of Minecraft is considered better, becuase it allows you to join any server, create mods, look into the code, and there are more options overall. This is only avialible on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Check out the video and and cool interactive timeline for more info on the history of Minecraft! </p>
