<h1>First things first</h1>
<p>There are an infinite amount of things to do in Minecraft, from creating and designing a city, to slaying monsters in the night. With this guide we are going to teach you how to beat the game in survival mode.
<h2>Getting the game: </h2>
<p style="color:white">Minecraft is an amazing game, but it needs to be downloaded. Go to <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft" target = "_blank">here</a> and choose your device and software. For computer, I recommend Java edition. Now just follow the instructions and download the game</p>
<p style="color:white"><h2>Creating a world</h2>
<p style="color:white">Start up Minecraft Launcher, click the big green button, and this gif will teach you the rest.</p>

<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p style="color:white">There are plenty of things to do once you start the game, but the most common is to first get wood. This allows you to craft lots of things like tools, torches, buildings, and more. </p>
<h2>Collecting Resources</h2>
<p>Now what you want to do is collect iron, diamond, and obsideon. Iron and diamon are great and useful resources that you can make armour and weapons with. They make you stronger and make the game easier. You need obsideon to create a portal to the Nether which has valuable resources that you'll need. To collect obsidian you can only mine it with an diamon pickaxe which requires 3 diamonds and 2 sticks. There is also a way to create a portal using <a href="https://youtu.be/DbCb33OqRpE?t=30" target = "_blank">lava and water.</a>
<h2>The Nether</h2>
<p>You build a nether portal by building a 4x6 rectangle with the inside hollow. You can save obsidian by cutting out the corners, and once you do that, you light the inside with a flint and steel. Recently there was a big expansion to the nether but what's most important is the nether fortress where blazes spawn. They drop blaze rods which can be made into blaze powder, combined with an ender pearl to create a eye of ender.</p>

<h2>Going to the End</h2>
<p>You can throw your eyes of ender and they will fly toward the direction of the stronghold which houses the end portal. Its deep underground so once your eyes of ender start going straight up, you dig straight down. In the stronghold you need to place eyes of ender into pieces of incomplete end portals. Then you can go into the end and fight the ender dragon.</p>

<h2>The End</h2>
<p>In the end you will fight the ender dragon. There are massive towers that carry end crystals which heal the dragon. You need to take those out either with a bow or climbing up and destroying it yourself. Once all the crystals are destroyed you attack the ender dragon until it dies, jump into the newly created portal, and complete the game.
